# ðŸ’° Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction using ML

Predicting personal loan acceptance using supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Complement Naive Bayes.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a bank customer will accept a personal loan offer based on their demographic and financial attributes. We implement and compare three supervised machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Complement Naive Bayes.

## Dataset

- `Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv` â€” The main dataset containing customer demographic, financial, and loan offer acceptance information.
- `uszips.xls` â€” A supplementary dataset containing information about U.S. zip codes.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Complement Naive Bayes
